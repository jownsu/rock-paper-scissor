# Frontend Mentor - Rock, Paper, Scissors solution

This is a solution to the [Rock, Paper, Scissors challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


### The challenge

### Screenshot
I am delighted to share with you a screenshot of my solution to the rock-paper-scissors challenge. In developing this solution, my primary goal was to create a visually appealing and engaging user experience. Users can select their weapon of choice, and the computer will choose its weapon at random. The result is displayed in a clean and intuitive layout, with clear information about the user's score and the outcome of each round. I have also incorporated elements such as sound effects and animations to further enhance the overall user experience. Overall, I believe that my solution is a significant improvement over traditional rock-paper-scissors interfaces, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback.
